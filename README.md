# Movies Industry Analysis and Correlations üé•üîçüìä
This project explores a dataset of over 7,000 movies (220 movies per year, 1986-2016) through data visualization techniques to uncover trends, correlations, and insights. 
The main dataset is movies.csv containing data on budgets, revenue, ratings, release year, and other attributes for thousands of movies.

Included in the GitHub repository is the dataset and jupyter notebook for the models run.

I explored and answered the following questions through data analytics and visualizations techniques.
